This directory contains the server-side javascript that we run before open the pages.

This two js file all manipulate with MYSQL, one of them focus on inserting new tempreture received from xbee & Arduino, 
the other one focus on responsing the request that sent from the front-end. 

The second one would manipulate the target data and send the json data back to the specific url for front-end to get them. Acting as a RESTful web service.
