Challenge 1 <br/>
Building a Nest Task: <br/>
Create a system that will continuously measure temperature in four locations in the room, compute the instantaneous average temperature and report these values to a central station. <br/>
Step 1: Calculating Thermistor Resistance use voltage-divider equation.<br/>
Step 2: Each sensor Calculates the Temperature use Steinhart-Hart equation.<br/>
Step 3: Every sensor sends temperature every 5 seconds to the base station. <br/>
Step 4: The base station Calculating the average of 4 temperature from 4 sensors.
