Challenge 1  Building a Nest </br>
Task: Create a system that will continuously measure temperature in four locations in the room, compute the instantaneous average temperature and report these values to a central station.</br>
Step 1:  Calculating  Thermistor Resistance use voltage-divider equation.</br> 
Step 2:  Each sensor Calculates the Temperature use Steinhart-Hart equation. </br>
Step 3:  Every sensor sends temperature every 5 seconds to the base station.</br>
Step 4:  The base station Calculating the average of 4 temperature from 4 sensors.</br>
